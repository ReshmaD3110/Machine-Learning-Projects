# Machine-Learning-Projects

### Introduction
Welcome to my Machine Learning Portfolio. This repository showcases a collection of diverse machine learning projects that demonstrate my skills in data analysis, model building, and problem-solving across various domains. Each project is designed to tackle real-world challenges using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques.

### Project Summaries

#### Cirrhosis Patient Survival Prediction

Description: This project aims to predict the survival of patients diagnosed with cirrhosis based on their clinical data.
Models Used: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine and XG Boost were implemented to classify patient outcomes and determine key survival indicators.

#### Customer Churn Prediction

Description: This project focuses on predicting customer churn in a telecom company, helping the company retain its valuable customers by identifying those at risk of leaving.
Models Used: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models were employed to analyze churn factors and predict customer behavior.

#### IMDB Review Text Classification

Description: In this project, the goal is to classify movie reviews from IMDB as positive or negative based on the text of the reviews.
Models Used: A TF-IDF vectorizer was used to convert text data into features and logistic regression model was to used to classify the positive and negative categories.

#### Real Estate Valuation

Description: This project estimates the market value of residential properties based on various features such as location, size, and amenities.
Models Used: Linear Regression with regularizations such as Ridge and Lasso Regressions were utilized to predict real estate prices and assess the impact of different property features.



This portfolio reflects my ability to apply machine learning techniques to a variety of datasets, providing valuable insights and predictions that can drive decision-making in different industries.
